INSTALLATION

Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene can be installed as follows:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Or if you prefer, just put EntrezGene.pm to the correct path like /MYPERLLIB/Bio/
ASN1.  That'd work.

DOCUMENTATION

For documentation, among many other things, please refer to the POD (
plain old documentation) inside the module.

Note that the regex_parser_test and parse_entrez_gene_example are two example
scripts included.  It is highly recommended that you check these scripts out!

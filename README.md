Bio-ASN1-Entrezgene
===================

This distribution includes:
1. XML parser-like parser for the ASN.1-formatted NCBI Entrez Gene files.
2. Indexer for Entrez Gene files.
3. XML parser-like parser for the ASN.1-formatted NCBI Sequence files.
4. Indexer for Sequence files.

These modules have quite high performance and error reporting capabilities.
Additionally, one could dump the data structure generated from extracted
NCBI object records into XML extremely easily using XML::Simple's XMLout().
